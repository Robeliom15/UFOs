# UFOs

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
This website is a collection of UFOs that have been spotted throughout the world. We wanted to have all this information all in one place so people could search for easily. We later decided to increase the search capabilities to make it easier to search. The previous way was too broad and would take time to find specific information.

### Results
The search box is located at the bottom left of the page.

Once you find out what type of UFO event you are interested in you simply enter the information into the search box. Once you start adding information the data will start to filter according to what you typed. You need to make sure that the information you enter also is spelled right so you can find the information you want. 

## Summary

With the added search options, we made it easier to look through the data we currently have, but the values must be exact. If you do not have exact values, then the search function will not find them. It might be helpful if the search function would search partial values. For example, in the shape box you enter tri it would still find the triangle UFO sightings. This would be helpful if someone doesn’t know exactly what they need. Additionally, having a picture section for each UFO sighting would help add to the website overall, but it won’t be available for every sighting.
